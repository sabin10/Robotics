## Matrix Game
#### Spaceship
Idea is inspired from a previous game that I developed https://github.com/sabin10/spaceship-game.

Developed with Arduino UNO, using LED Matrix, LCD Display, Joystick, two Buttons.

Maybe a 3D printed retro console https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1277483.

#### Hardware
1. 8x8 LED Matrix (for playing)
2. LCD (for menu)
3. Joystick (for menu control)
4. two Buttons (for game control)
5. Buzzer (for 8-bit song while playing) maybe

#### Game Specifications
1. Gets more challenging with time by creating more obstacles and by increasing the speed of ship.
2. Keeping a score.
3. Increasing level like level 1(score in range[0, 10]), level 2(score in range[10, 30])...
4. Having 3 lives.
5. Save Highscore in EEPROM
